  # - title: "Defensive DevOps"
  #   slug: "defensive-devops"
  #   long: "Half-day"
  #   level: "Intermediate"
  #   description: "The DevOps revolution is in full swing, with a variety of tools and techniques being announced and implemented every day. Our systems no longer look to deploy on physical hardware, instead aiming to be hosted on the cloud and other virtualised systems.
# But, how do we do this securely? All these automation tools are still programming, and programming is always filled with bugs and security holes.
# In this session, we will go through the rise of the DevOps revolution, and what it means both from a technical and cultural standpoint. We’ll talk about how to model where your points of failure will be, and which ones will be the most catastrophic. We’ll talk about security, how it’s a reliability concern, and how best to make it part of your journey to sustainability."
