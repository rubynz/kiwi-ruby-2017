  - title: "Defensive DevOps"
    slug: "defensive-devops"
    long: "Half-day"
    level: "Intermediate"
    description: "The DevOps revolution is in full swing, with a variety of tools and techniques being announced and implemented every day. Our systems no longer look to deploy on physical hardware, instead aiming to be hosted on the cloud and other virtualised systems.
But, how do we do this securely? All these automation tools are still programming, and programming is always filled with bugs and security holes.
In this session, we will go through the rise of the DevOps revolution, and what it means both from a technical and cultural standpoint. We’ll talk about how to model where your points of failure will be, and which ones will be the most catastrophic. We’ll talk about security, how it’s a reliability concern, and how best to make it part of your journey to sustainability."

In this workshop, you will learn what it takes to build a chatbot, and enable it to converse using natural language processing. We will then explore other machine learning tools and incorporate them into your bot. While we will be working off examples, feel free to also bring your own project ideas to this interactive workshop."

  #   description: "Found yourself tangled up in hard-to-maintain code? Been building app after app in the same way and never finding a way to make significant improvements? Vaunted object-oriented design principles proving too elusive or hard to apply? Thinking maybe it’s time to leave Ruby (_gasp!_) for something different?

# If you’ve answered yes to any of these questions, this workshop is for you!

# Come along and learn how to build a new generation of Ruby web app with dry-rb: an app that is robust, cleanly architected, and just as easy to build now as it will be to maintain later."
